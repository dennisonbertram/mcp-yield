# Performance Fix: O(n²) to O(n) Optimization

## Task Details
Fix O(n²) performance issues in lending yields and vault yields tools by replacing nested find() operations with Map-based O(1) lookups.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Performance tests pass with large datasets (1000 items)
- [x] Lending yields tool uses Map-based lookup instead of nested find()
- [x] Vault yields tool analyzed - no O(n²) issue found, kept original O(n) implementation
- [x] All existing tests continue to pass (30/30 tests passing)
- [x] Performance improvement verified through benchmarks (27% improvement for lending yields)

## Feasibility Assessment
✅ **FEASIBLE** - This is a straightforward performance optimization:
- Real API responses from StakeKit are used (no mocking)
- Map-based lookups are a standard optimization technique
- No external dependencies or credentials required
- Code already works, just needs optimization

## Dependency Verification
✅ All dependencies are already in place:
- StakeKit client configured and working
- TypeScript and testing infrastructure set up
- No new dependencies needed

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: TDD RED - Write Performance Tests
1. Create performance test for lending yields with large dataset
2. Create performance test for vault yields with large dataset
3. Verify tests fail with current O(n²) implementation

### Phase 2: TDD GREEN - Implement Map-based Lookups
1. Fix lending yields tool (lines 465-466)
2. Fix vault yields tool (lines 492-502)
3. Verify performance tests pass

### Phase 3: TDD REFACTOR - Clean Up
1. Refactor for readability if needed
2. Ensure all existing tests still pass
3. Document performance improvements

## Progress Tracking

### TDD Cycles

#### Cycle 1: Performance Test for Lending Yields
- [x] RED: Write test for lending yields performance with 1000 items dataset
- [x] GREEN: Implement Map-based lookup - improved from 37ms to 27ms (27% improvement)
- [x] REFACTOR: Code is clean and readable, no refactoring needed

#### Cycle 2: Performance Test for Vault Yields
- [x] RED: Write test for vault yields performance with 1000 items dataset
- [x] GREEN: Determined vault yields doesn't have O(n²) issue, kept original implementation
- [x] REFACTOR: No refactoring needed as the original code was already O(n)

### Implementation Details

#### Lending Yields Fix
**Problem**: The lending yields tool had O(n²) complexity due to nested `find()` operations:
```typescript
// Before (O(n²)):
items: filteredSummaries.map((summary) => ({
  ...summary,
  collateralFactor: response.raw.find((entry) => entry.id === summary.id)?.metrics?.collateralFactor,
  borrowApy: response.raw.find((entry) => entry.id === summary.id)?.metrics?.borrowApy
}))
```

**Solution**: Implemented Map-based lookup for O(1) access:
```typescript
// After (O(n)):
const entryMap = new Map(response.raw.map((entry) => [entry.id, entry]));
items: filteredSummaries.map((summary) => {
  const entry = entryMap.get(summary.id);
  return {
    ...summary,
    collateralFactor: entry?.metrics?.collateralFactor,
    borrowApy: entry?.metrics?.borrowApy
  };
})
```

**Performance Impact**: 27% improvement (37ms → 27ms for 1000 items)

#### Vault Yields Analysis
- Initially appeared to have similar issue but investigation showed it's already O(n)
- Calls `buildYieldSummaries([entry])[0]` for each entry (O(n), not O(n²))
- Attempted optimization actually made it slower, so kept original implementation
- Performance is acceptable at ~20ms for 1000 items

### Test Results
- All 30 tests pass
- Performance tests verify improvements:
  - Lending yields: 27ms for 1000 items (< 30ms threshold)
  - Vault yields: 20ms for 1000 items (< 25ms threshold)
- No regression in existing functionality

## Observed Issues
None - all tests pass and performance improved.
