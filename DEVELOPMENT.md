# Type Safety Fixes Development Plan

## Task Details
Fix type safety violations in the codebase using strict TDD methodology.

## Success Criteria
1. ✅ All type safety violations are fixed
2. ✅ Tests written first (RED phase) before implementation
3. ✅ Code handles malformed API responses gracefully
4. ✅ No use of `any` types where specific types can be defined
5. ✅ All tests passing

## Feasibility Assessment
- **Can this be implemented with real data/APIs?** YES - Improving type safety for existing API integrations
- **Dependencies available?** YES - All required packages are already installed
- **Credentials required?** YES - StakeKit API key already configured in environment

## Issues to Fix

### Issue 1: Unsafe type cast in catalog.ts:33
- **Current:** Using `any` type for array mapping
- **Solution:** Add proper type guards and filtering

### Issue 2: Weak validation in stakekit.ts:59
- **Current:** Using `z.array(z.any())` for components
- **Solution:** Define proper schema for reward components

## TDD Implementation Plan

### Cycle 1: Fix catalog.ts type safety
- [ ] RED: Write test for malformed API response handling (missing token field)
- [ ] GREEN: Implement type-safe filter in catalog.ts
- [ ] REFACTOR: Clean up code while keeping tests green

### Cycle 2: Fix stakekit.ts type validation
- [ ] RED: Write test for invalid reward components
- [ ] GREEN: Add rewardComponentSchema to types
- [ ] REFACTOR: Optimize schema definitions

### Cycle 3: Integration verification
- [ ] RED: Write integration test for complete flow
- [ ] GREEN: Ensure all components work together
- [ ] REFACTOR: Final cleanup

## Progress Log

### TDD Cycle 1: Catalog Type Safety
- **Started:** 2025-01-18
- **RED Phase:** ✅ Wrote comprehensive tests for malformed API responses
  - Test for missing fields, null values, wrong types
  - Test for completely invalid responses
  - Test for deeply nested malformed data
  - Tests initially failed as expected
- **GREEN Phase:** ✅ Implemented type-safe filtering
  - Added safeParseArray function to filter out malformed items
  - Handles null, undefined, and schema-invalid items gracefully
  - All tests now passing
- **REFACTOR Phase:** ✅ Improved code organization
  - Extracted helper functions for better modularity
  - Added comprehensive JSDoc comments
  - Separated concerns: extractArrayFromResponse and safeParseArray
  - Tests still pass after refactoring

### TDD Cycle 2: StakeKit Type Validation
- **RED Phase:** ✅ Wrote tests for type validation
  - Tests for reward schema validation
  - Tests for token ref schema validation
  - Tests for yield schema with complex nested data
  - Tests for reward components
- **GREEN Phase:** ✅ Added rewardComponentSchema
  - Created comprehensive schema for reward components
  - Added support for components array in rewardSchema
  - Exported RewardComponent type
- **REFACTOR Phase:** ✅ Already clean implementation
  - Schema definitions are well-organized
  - Types are properly exported
  - All tests remain green

### TDD Cycle 3: Integration Testing
- **RED Phase:** ✅ Wrote integration tests
  - End-to-end type safety tests
  - Mixed valid/invalid data handling
  - Error handling and recovery
- **GREEN Phase:** ✅ All tests pass
  - Implementation handles all test cases
  - Type safety maintained throughout data flow
- **REFACTOR Phase:** ✅ No refactoring needed
  - Code is clean and maintainable
