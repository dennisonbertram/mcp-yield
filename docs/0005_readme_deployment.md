# Task 0005 – Documentation & Deployment Guide

## Objectives
- Produce comprehensive README covering project purpose, setup, usage, and troubleshooting.
- Document deployment pathways (local stdio, Docker, and optional managed hosting).
- Provide repeatable testing instructions for curl and MCP stdio workflows.

## README Structure
1. **Introduction** – What the server does, high-level architecture, links to planning docs.
2. **Quick Start**
   - Prerequisites (Node 18+, npm).
   - Installation steps (`npm install`, `.env` configuration).
   - Running in development (`npm run dev`) and production (`npm run build && npm run start:stdio`).
3. **Configuration** – Environment variables (`STAKEKIT_API_KEY`, optional overrides).
4. **Available Tools** – Table listing tool names, descriptions, arguments, sample usage.
5. **Resources & Prompts** – Summary of dynamic resources and guidance prompts.
6. **Testing** – Instructions for unit tests, integration tests, live smoke tests with env toggles.
7. **Troubleshooting** – Common errors (missing API key, 429 rate limit, schema validation failure) with fixes.
8. **Development Workflow** – Branching strategy, coding standards, lint/test commands, commit guidelines.
9. **Deployment** – Steps for packaging with Docker (Dockerfile, example command), environment secrets management, logging.
10. **Appendix** – API references, glossary, links to external docs.

## Additional Artifacts
- `Dockerfile` for building minimal Node runtime (Alpine or Debian slim) with non-root user.
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` capturing pre-flight checks (env vars set, tests passing, API quota verified).
- Update `docs/YIELD_API_TESTING_RESULTS.md` with final manual/stdio transcripts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- README contains copy-pastable commands and real examples (with placeholders for secrets).
- Deployment instructions verified by running Docker image locally (`docker build`, `docker run`).
- Testing section references both automated (`npm test`) and manual stdio workflows.
- Troubleshooting includes guidance on interpreting MCP error payloads.
- Documentation reviewed for clarity and accuracy; linted with markdownlint (optional but recommended).
