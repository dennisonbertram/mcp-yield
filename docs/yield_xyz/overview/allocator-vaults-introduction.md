# Allocator Vaults & OAVs Introduction

Optimized Allocator Vaults (OAVs) enhance DeFi asset management by dynamically allocating user funds across multiple yield-bearing strategies to optimize returns. They automate complex tasks, including fee management and reinvesting of incentive tokens in order to boost yields through compounding. OAVs feature an advanced True APY (TAPY) calculation, providing accurate yield metrics by incorporating real-world factors such as token conversions, market slippage, and compounding frequency. Additionally, OAVs support flexible withdrawal options like conditional cooldowns, robust risk management, and comprehensive governance controls.

Yield.xyz clients can customize their vault configurations by selecting preferred yield strategies and fee structures (performance, management, or deposit fees), and deploy these yield opportunities in their products within days.
