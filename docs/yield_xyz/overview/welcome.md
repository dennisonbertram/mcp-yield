# Welcome to Yield.xyz

**Yield.xyz** is the most complete API for integrating non-custodial, on-chain yield — including staking, restaking, liquid staking, DeFi lending, RWA yields, vaults, and more. Whether you're building a wallet, custody platform, neobank, exchange, or on-chain agent, Yield.xyz gives you one standardized interface to access yield across 70+ networks.

**Designed for full self-custody**, the API constructs complete transaction flows but leaves execution and signing entirely in your control — compatible with browser wallets, smart contract accounts, MPC, and institutional custody platforms.

Originally developed as the backbone of [Omni](https://omni.app), one of the most advanced staking wallets in Web3, our infrastructure has been refined through years of production use and real-world feedback. Today, it powers Yield.xyz — the trusted yield layer behind platforms like **Ledger, Zerion, and Tangem**, serving **4M+ users** and supporting **hundreds of millions in monthly volume**.

## Why Yield.xyz?

- **Unified Interface** — Every protocol and opportunity is abstracted into a consistent, schema-based format: one format for metadata, one for actions, one for balances.
- **Instant Integration** — No need to write custom logic for Cosmos staking vs. Aave lending — integrate once, support everything.
- **Self-Custodial by Design** — Transactions are returned fully constructed but never executed — you sign and broadcast using any infrastructure: wallets, smart contracts, or custody platforms.
- **Battle-Tested Infrastructure** — Built on the stack that powers millions of real-world transactions and billions in TVL.
- **Chain-Agnostic** — Works across EVM and non-EVM chains, including Ethereum, Cosmos, Tron and Solana.
- **Monetizable** — Configure deposit, performance, and management fees or earn validator rebates directly in your integration.

## What You Can Build

- **Wallets** — Add staking, DeFi flows with full control over UX, signing, and monetization.
- **Custodians & Fintechs** — Offer on-chain yield on crypto or stablecoin balances with full transparency and fee control.
- **AI Agents** — Query all available yield actions and execute optimal strategies using standard schemas.
- **Aggregators & Infra** — Compose multi-step flows using a unified transaction model — no chain-specific code required.

---

## What You Get

- **Yields** — Each yield represents an opportunity: staking, restaking, lending, vaults, or RWA strategies — with standardized metadata, reward mechanics, and execution logic.
- **Actions** — Each yield supports consistent actions like `enter`, `exit`, and `manage`, using schema-based inputs.
- **Balances** — Retrieve unified views of user positions across all lifecycle stages: active, entering, exiting, claimable, and more.
- **Protocols** — Yields are grouped by protocol (e.g. Aave, Morpho, EigenLayer) and network (Cosmos, Ethereum, Base) for easy discovery and filtering.

## Developer Experience

### API

Use our REST API to discover yields, construct transactions, and manage user positions. Everything is normalized across chains, lifecycle-aware, and compatible with your existing infra. Explore the [API reference](/reference/getting-started-with-your-api#/) to get started.

### SDKs

For TypeScript projects, our SDKs offer a type-safe interface over the API — with built-in helpers for signing, formatting, and transaction management. Supports hardware wallets, mnemonics, and contract wallets out of the box.

### Guides & Recipes

Get started in minutes with our [Core Concepts](/docs/core-concepts#/) and ready-made [code recipes](/recipes#/) — covering common flows like staking, restaking, claiming, or multi-step actions.
