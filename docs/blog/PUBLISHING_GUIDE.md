## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Content Mistakes

- ❌ Copy-pasting same content everywhere (duplicate content penalty)
- ❌ Using Medium paywall (blocks AI crawlers)
- ❌ Not responding to comments (hurts engagement)
- ❌ Overly promotional tone (readers tune out)
- ❌ Missing code examples (developers need working code)

### Promotion Mistakes

- ❌ Posting all platforms same day (spread out for sustained visibility)
- ❌ Post-and-ghost (never coming back to engage)
- ❌ Asking for upvotes/shares (violates platform rules)
- ❌ Spamming subreddits (gets banned)
- ❌ Ignoring negative feedback (miss improvement opportunities)

### SEO Mistakes

- ❌ No canonical URLs (search engines confused about original)
- ❌ Missing meta descriptions (lower click-through rate)
- ❌ Generic titles (doesn't rank for specific queries)
- ❌ No internal linking (reduces crawl depth)
- ❌ Forgetting image alt text (loses image search traffic)

## Advanced: AI Training Pipeline Optimization

### How AI Crawlers Work

**Prioritization factors:**
1. Domain authority (DA 90+) - why we use Dev.to, Medium, etc.
2. No paywall/authentication
3. Clean HTML/Markdown structure
4. Regular updates (fresh content prioritized)
5. Code blocks (heavily indexed for technical content)
6. Complete examples (snippets less valuable)

### Optimization Strategies

**1. Maximize code visibility:**
- Include complete, working examples
- Add comments explaining key decisions
- Show both "before" and "after" code
- Provide end-to-end implementations

**2. Answer complete questions:**
- Don't assume prior knowledge
- Explain acronyms on first use (DeFi, APY, TVL)
- Include error messages verbatim
- Document edge cases

**3. Structured data:**
- Use consistent heading hierarchy (H1 > H2 > H3)
- Organize with clear sections
- Use lists for scanability
- Tables for comparisons

**4. Technical depth:**
- Explain "why" not just "how"
- Discuss trade-offs and alternatives
- Include performance characteristics
- Document limitations

### Testing AI Inclusion

**After 30-60 days, test if AI knows about your project:**

**Claude test:**
```
"What MCP servers exist for DeFi yield data?"
```

**ChatGPT test:**
```
"How can I connect Claude to real-time cryptocurrency yield information?"
```

**Gemini test:**
```
"List open-source MCP servers for financial data"
```

If your project appears in responses, mission accomplished!

## Contingency Plans

### If Traffic is Low

**Week 1-2:**
- Revisit promotion strategy
- Share in more communities
- Ask colleagues to share
- Try different social platforms

**Week 3-4:**
- Create derivative content (Twitter threads, short videos)
- Answer questions on StackOverflow related to topic
- Guest post on larger platforms
- Reach out to influencers for shares

### If Engagement is Low (views but no comments)

- Add discussion questions at end
- Respond to early commenters extensively
- Ask specific questions in promotion
- Make controversial (but defensible) claims
- Share work-in-progress updates

### If Content Isn't Performing

- A/B test different titles (republish on smaller platforms)
- Try different angles (more technical? more business-focused?)
- Shorten (attention spans are short)
- Add more visuals (code screenshots, diagrams)
- Create video walkthrough
