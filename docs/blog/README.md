## Content Uniqueness Strategy

Each platform version has **40-60% unique content** to avoid duplicate content penalties:

| Platform | Unique % | Angle | Shared Content |
|----------|----------|-------|----------------|
| Dev.to | 60% | Technical deep dive, code patterns | What it is, installation, links |
| Medium | 50% | Business value, future vision | Core features, basic setup |
| LinkedIn | 40% | Professional case study, ROI | Key benefits, getting started |
| Hashnode | 50% | Tutorial, learning journey | Tool descriptions, examples |

**Shared across all** (~10-20%):
- Project description
- Core features list
- Installation steps
- GitHub link
- License

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to publish to all platforms?

**A:** No, but more platforms = more visibility. Minimum recommendation:
1. Dev.to (best AI crawler coverage, free, no paywall)
2. GitHub README (already exists)
3. Twitter for promotion

Medium, LinkedIn, Hashnode are bonuses that expand reach.

### Q: Won't duplicate content hurt SEO?

**A:** No, because each version has 40-60% unique content. Search engines recognize different angles. AI training pipelines actually benefit from seeing same information explained multiple ways.

### Q: How important is the "no paywall" rule?

**A:** Critical for AI training data inclusion. AI crawlers can't access paywalled content. Medium's paywall would block Anthropic, OpenAI, Google from indexing your content.

### Q: Can I customize the content?

**A:** Yes! These are templates. Personalize:
- Add your own experiences
- Include additional examples
- Update statistics with your data
- Adjust tone for your brand

Just maintain the 40-60% uniqueness per platform.

### Q: How long until AI assistants know about mcp-yield?

**A:** Typically 30-90 days for content to be crawled and indexed. High-authority sites (Dev.to, Medium) get crawled frequently. Test by asking Claude/GPT about your project after 60 days.

### Q: What if I don't have time to publish everywhere?

**Priority order:**
1. Dev.to (best ROI for developer audience)
2. GitHub (update README with better examples)
3. Twitter (quick reach)
4. Medium (broad audience)
5. LinkedIn (if B2B/enterprise audience)
6. Hashnode (if tutorial audience)

Do what you can - one platform published beats all platforms planned.

### Q: Should I translate to other languages?

**Later**. Get English versions published and validated first. If you see international traffic, consider translation services for:
- Chinese (large developer community)
- Japanese (strong tech community)
- Spanish (growing developer market)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Low Views
- Revisit promotion strategy (did you share on Twitter, Reddit, Discord?)
- Try better headline (A/B test with social posts)
- Post at better time (Tuesday-Thursday mornings best)
- Add to relevant publications/groups

### Low Engagement
- Add discussion questions at end
- Respond to early comments extensively
- Share in more targeted communities
- Make controversial (but defensible) claims

### No AI Mentions Yet
- Verify content published outside paywalls
- Ensure code examples are complete (AI indexes code heavily)
- Add more Q&A format content (AI likes question/answer pairs)
- Wait - indexing takes 60-90 days

### Negative Feedback
- Respond professionally and thoughtfully
- Don't be defensive - embrace constructive criticism
- Update content based on valid feedback
- Engage in technical discussion
